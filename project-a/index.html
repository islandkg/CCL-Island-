                <p>Silere-Echinoidea (shy sea urchin)</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Jacques Cousteau discovered this creature during the 1970-80s expedition missions to find the titanic. 
                    This creature was discovered near the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This creature is a part of the Phylum Echinodermata family just as S
                    tarfish and Sea urchins are. This is due to its similar abilities, appearance and tendencies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Deep-sea ocean biome, salt water.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p> Round dark purple body with a central tiny body (lighter purple). 
                    This body is surrounded by a double helix shape that continuously rotates for 
                    advanced locomotion and defense. This helix shape CAN change when the creature is 
                    faced with a possible threat.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Camouflage ability when feeling endangered.</li>
                    <li>Ability to expand and change helix barrier for defense.</li>
                    <li>Eats plankton and algae</li>

                This creature seems to be mostly harmless during the winter and fall seasons, however when summer comes, due to an increase in sunlight, the creature 
                will become more and more agitated and scared allowing for Shymin to utilize all of its defense mechanisms (increase in size, change of helix shape...).
                Shymin is mostly harmless as it's diet consists of mainly plant-type nutrients however when Shymin becomes agitated, its diet will slightly shift to a more
                "scavenger-like" diet.
                This creature has numerous hidden eyes that allow for 360 vision. This allows for the creature to detect any potential threats nearby.

                creature, the beast will blend into the biome that it is in using controlled changes in its microscopic pigments. If you want to take a picture, 
                click "S" key to TOGGLE phone and "H" key to HIDE phone. Once your phone is in your hand, click on the screen to take a picture and see 
                how the creature reacts. HINT : Keep taking photos!
